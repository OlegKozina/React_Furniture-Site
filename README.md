#Feature/components

##This PR adds 7 sections to the website. Most of the sections include pictures and text, using the modified MediaWithText component.

##When creating the sections I followed the design for spacing, typography, and colors.

#Notables:
- Used the modified Blockquote component for the last section with 2 quotes.
- Created the CustomCard component for adding 3 cards to section 3.
- Created a CustomButton component which has a prop for changing button color based on the section.
- Modified the BackDropImage component for using it across different sections.
- Improved responsiveness for different screen sizes and added one more width to width.ts for the text and headings in the sections.

#Testing?
All sections have been tested to ensure they display correctly and are responsive across different devices.
